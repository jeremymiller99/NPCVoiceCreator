## Tips for Best Results

- **Clear Speech**: Use recordings with clear, distinct speech
- **Minimal Background Noise**: Cleaner audio produces better results
- **Experiment with Settings**: 
  - Lower pitch (1.0-1.5) = deeper, more serious voices
  - Higher pitch (2.0-3.0) = cute, playful voices
  - Faster speed (2.0+) = makes speech unintelligible like NPC voice
  - Slower speed (0.5-1.0) = more understandable but still stylized
  - Smaller segment length = more choppy/staccato effect
  - Higher pitch variation = more character personality

## Technical Details

## How It Works

This tool uses advanced audio processing to create stylized NPC character speech. The conversion process involves several key steps:

### 1. Audio Segmentation
Your audio is divided into small time-based segments (controlled by the Segment Length parameter). Each segment represents a single sound or syllable.

### 2. Pitch Shifting
Each segment undergoes pitch modification to create the characteristic high-pitched voice. The base Pitch Shift parameter sets the overall pitch level, while Pitch Variation adds randomness to make each segment unique.

### 3. Time Compression
Segments are sped up according to the Speed parameter, creating the rapid-fire speech pattern typical of NPC dialogue.

### 4. Reassembly
The processed segments are reconnected with small gaps between them, creating the distinctive choppy, staccato effect characteristic of NPC speech.

## Notes

- Larger audio files may take longer to process
- Processing happens in your browser - no data is uploaded
- All audio remains private on your device

## Customization

Feel free to modify the default parameters in the code:
- Open `index.html` and adjust the `value` attributes on the range inputs
- Open `styles.css` to customize colors and styling
